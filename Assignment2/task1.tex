  The  transistor  model was modified to look as follows:\\
  Cgs  2 3 20E-12\\ 
  Cgd 1 2 10E-12\\
  M1 1 2 3 3 MOST1 W=500u L=2u\\
  .MODEL MOST1 NMOS(Level=3 Kp=20u W=500u L=2u Rs=20m Vto=2 Rd=1.186)\\\\

  The following parameters were used: kn =  20  $\mu$A/V2,  W/L =  250,  VT =  2  V,  Cgs =  20  pF, Cgd = 10 pF\\

\subsection*{1.2}
  % Using  the  above  parameters  (here:  kn =  20  ÂµA/V2,  W/L =  250,  VT =  2  V,  Cgs =  20  pF,
  % Cgd = 10 pF) perform the theoretical analysis of the circuit to find the voltage gain, input
  % resistance, output resistance, as well as to estimate the lower and upper 3dB frequencies.

  A theoretical analysis of the circuit in figure 1 was performed to find the voltage gain, input resistance, output resistance, as well as to estimate the lower and upper 3dB frequencies.\\\\

  To find the voltage gain the DC current, I$_D$, was found to be 379$\mu$A and used to calculate\\ g$_m$ = $\frac{1}{513.5 \Omega}$. Using the small signal t-model the midband gain was found to be $$\frac{v_o}{v_i} = |-10.615| \frac{V}{V} = 20.518 dB$$.\\\\

  The lower and upper 3dB frequencies were found doing a low and high frequency analysis of the circuit. Capacitors C$_1$1, C$_2$ and C$_3$ are much larger than capacitors C$_{gs}$ and C$_{gd}$ so for the low frequency analysis C$_{gs}$ and C$_{gd}$ can be neglected and vice versa.\\

  Calculations from the high frequency analysis using a small signal hybrid-pi model show that $$f_{H 3dB} = 2.918MHz$$

  Calculations from the low frequency analysis using a small signal T model show that $$f_{L 3dB} = 34.18Hz$$

  The input resistance of the circuit, R$_{in}$, is the parallell connection of R$_{G1}$ and R$_{G2}$, $$R_{in} = R_{G1}||R_{G2} = 257k\Omega$$
  The output resitance of the circuti, R$_{out}$, is the drain resistance, R$_D$ = 12k$\Omega$.\\\\

  All calculations can be seen in Appendix 1.\\

  % Determine the values of the same parameters by simulation. Note that in order to obtain
  % some  of  the  parameters  certain  changes  in  the  circuit  diagram  and/or  introducing  some
  % auxiliary elements may be necessary. 

  A simulation was done for the circuit in figure 1 to find the voltage gain, input resistance, output resistance, as well as to estimate the lower and upper 3dB frequencies.\\\\

  The drain current was found using a DC operating point analysis and the results show that \\I$_D$ = 379.244$\mu$A as seen in figure 2. The voltage at the top node is positive so the current is flowing downward from the perspective of figure 1.\\

  An AC analysis was used to find the gain, $$f_{L 3dB}$$ $$f_{H 3dB}$$ From the results of this analysis seen in figure 3 and 4, the gain is $$A_1 = \frac{v_o}{v_i} = 20.521 dB = 10.618 \frac{V}{V}$$ $$f_{L 3dB} = 35.592 Hz$$ $$f_{H 3dB} = 2.953MHz$$

  The input resistance, R$_in$, was found by adding an signal resistance. The signal resistance is chosen close to what is assumed to be the correct input resistance calculated by theory in task 1.2 R$_{in}$ = $R_{G1}||R_{G2}$ = 257k$\Omega$. Using this resistance as seen in figure 5, an AC analysis seen in figure 6 is performed to see how the gain changes.\\

  \end{figure}

The gain with the added resistance is $$A_2 = 10^{14.6115/20} = 5.377 dB$$
The input resitance can then be calculated using the following formula:
$$R_{in} = \frac{R_s}{A_1 / A_2 - A_2} = \frac{R_s \cdot A_2}{A_1 - A_2} = \frac{250k\Omega \cdot 5.377}{10.618 - 5.377} = 256.5 k\Omega$$

\pagebreak

The output resitance, R$_{out}$, was found by removing the load resistance, see figure 7, from the original circuit and performing an AC analysis to see how the gain changes.\\

  \end{figure}

Obesrving the gain in figure 8 to be $$A_3 = 10^{27.3699/20} dB = 23.361 dB$$
The output resistance can then be calculated using the following formula: 
$$R_{out} = R_L\frac{A_3 - A_1}{A_1} = 10k\Omega \frac{23.361-10.618}{10.618} = 12 k\Omega$$
