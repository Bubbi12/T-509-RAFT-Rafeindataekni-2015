%1. Build the circuit shown below using BS170 transistor and a resistor RD = 470 . %Supply
%voltage is VDD = +15 V. Transistor gate is connected to a variable power supply.

\subsection*{1.2}
% 2. Determine the threshold voltage and the transconductance parameter k of the MOS
%transistor. In particular, find the voltage VT for which noticeable drain current appears,
%and the voltage VG for which the drain current equals ID0 = 10 mA (use the voltage drop
%across the resistor RD to determine the value of the current). Determine k using the
%formula k = ID0/(VG – VT)2. Note that the parameter k here includes W/L and 0.5 factor
%that you have in the drain current formula ID = 0.5 kn’W/L(VGS–VT)2, i.e., k = 0.5kn’W/L.
