%2. Use Bode Analyzer to measure the AC characteristic of the amplifier in the frequency
%range 10 Hz to 50 kHz. Use 10 steps per decade and input signal amplitude of 50 mV.
%Find the lower 3dB frequency of the circuit.

From figure X, the 3dB frequency can be seen as 1000 kHz and the midband gain $A_1 = 24.05 dB = 10^{24.05/20) \frac{V}{V} = 15.94 \frac{V}{V}}$

%3. Determine the following parameters of the circuit (at the frequency 1 kHz): voltage gain,
%input resistance, output resistance. Input signal amplitude should be small, e.g., 50 mV.
%Observe and store the input and output signal waveforms using oscilloscope.

% 4. Using the transistor parameters obtained in Task 1, determine the values of gain,
%input/output resistance and the lower 3dB frequency theoretically compare them to the
%values obtained experimentally.

The transistor parameters obtained in Task 1 were used to determine the values of gain, input/output resistance and the lower 3dB frequency theoretically. Calculations can be seen in appendix I.\\
