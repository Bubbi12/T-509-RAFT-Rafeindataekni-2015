    %Build a half-wave rectifier as shown below using a diode and resistor R = 33 k$\Omega$. Input
    %signal vs should be taken from the function generator. Use sinusoidal signal of frequency
    %100 Hz and amplitude about 2.5 V.

    A half-wave rectifier as shown in figure 1 below, was built using a  diode and r, R=33k$\Omega$.
    A sinusoidal signal of frequency 100 Hz and with a amplitude of about 2.5 V was used as the input signal, v$_s$.\\

    %Observe  the  input  signal  vs and  output  signal  vo using  the  oscilloscope.  
    %Determine  the voltage drop across the diode.

    The input signal, v$_s$, and the output signal, v$_o$, were observed using the oscilloscope and the voltage drop across the diode was determined.\\

    Using values read from the oscilloscope seen in figure 2 above, the voltage drop across the diode was determined using the following formula.

    $$V_d = V_{s peak} - V_{o peak} = A\ V - B\ V = X\ V$$

\subsection*{3}
    %Modify the rectifier circuit as shown below:

    The half-wave rectifier circuit was modified by adding a capacitor C in parallel with resistor R as shown in figure 3 below.
